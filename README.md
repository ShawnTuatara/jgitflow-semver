QuickSign JGitFlow SemVer
=========================

Provides [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) using Gitflow. Highly based on [amkay's gradle-gitflow](https://github.com/amkay/gradle-gitflow) work but rewritten in pure Java without any Gradle dependencies and focused on being used as a JVM library and as a standalone command line program.
